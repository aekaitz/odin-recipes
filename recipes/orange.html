        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Roasted cauliflower in a sticky sweet orange sauce that’s loaded with diced peppers. This Orange Cauliflower tastes like delicious take-out, but it’s made in the comfort of your own kitchen and ready in less than 30 minutes!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li>1 large head of cauliflower</li>
        <li>¼ cup + 2 tbsp vegetable broth</li>
        <li>½ of a red onion diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>2 sweet bell peppers diced (I used 1 red and 1 orange)</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups + 1 tbsp fresh squeezed orange juice</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari use wheat-free tamari for gluten-free</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons pure maple syrup</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water or more juice</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds for garnish if desired</li>
        <li>Cooked Rice for serving</li>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450°F.</li>
            <li>Cut the cauliflower into large bite size florets. In a medium bowl toss the cauliflower with 1 tablespoon juice.</li>
            <li>Place the cauliflower in one even layer on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes, (Add an additional 5 minutes if desired, but I like mine to still have a crunch). Cauliflower should be just browning on the edges.</li>
            <li>While the cauliflower is roasting, whisk together the orange juice, soy sauce, maple syrup, and vinegar. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Stir together the cornstarch and water until smooth and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add ¼ cup vegetable broth to a large pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté 5 to 6 minutes until soft.</li>
            <li>Add another 2 tbsp vegetable broth to the pan and add the peppers. Sauté 5 to 6 minutes until softened.</li>
            <li>When the peppers are softened, add the orange sauce to the pan and turn up the heat to bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, add the cornstarch/water mixture and stir well to incorporate. Simmer over medium heat until the sauce reduces and thickens to almost a syrup like consistency.</li>
            <li>Add the cauliflower to the sauce when it’s done roasting and stir to coat well.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle sesame seeds over the top, if using, and serve immediately by itself or over rice.</li>
        </ol>
